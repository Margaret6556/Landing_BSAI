      <h2>Real-story: How BreathSync AI Can Save Me During an Asthma Attack</h2>
      <div className="story">

          <span class="quote">“</span> I never thought I would find myself in
          such a terrifying situation. Last summer, I was on a hike with my
          family when my asthma suddenly flared up. I had not used my inhaler
          for a few days, and I did not even realize I had missed a dose. Out of
          nowhere, I was struggling to breathe, and panic set in. But luckily, I
          had my BreathSync AI inhaler with me. The app had already detected
          that Iwould missed my scheduled doses and immediately sent a reminder
          earlier that morning. As the attack worsened, BreathSync AI alerted me
          with an emergency reminder, and with shaky hands, I used my inhaler
          just in time. The AI even tracked my recovery in real-time and sent
          data to my doctor, who was able to advise me on next steps within
          minutes. Thanks to BreathSync AI, what could have been a
          life-threatening event was managed quickly and effectively, giving me
          peace of mind and, more importantly, my breath back.

        breathe. It felt like my lungs were closing in. My inhaler wasn’t
        helping. I panicked, gasping for air, and my husband had to rush me to
        the ER. I felt like I was drowning in slow motion.
