        Real-story: How BreathSync AI Can Save Me During an Asthma Attack
      </h2>
      <div className="story">
        <p>
          <span class="quote">“</span>I never thought I would find myself in
          such a terrifying situation. Last summer, I was on a hike with my
          family when my asthma suddenly flared up. I had not used my inhaler
          for a few days, and I did not even realize I had missed a dose. Out of
          nowhere, I was struggling to breathe, and panic set in. But luckily, I
          had my BreathSync AI inhaler with me. The app had already detected
          that Iwould missed my scheduled doses and immediately sent a reminder
          earlier that morning. As the attack worsened, BreathSync AI alerted me
          with an emergency reminder, and with shaky hands, I used my inhaler
          just in time. The AI even tracked my recovery in real-time and sent
          data to my doctor, who was able to advise me on next steps within
          minutes. Thanks to BreathSync AI, what could have been a
          life-threatening event was managed quickly and effectively, giving me
          peace of mind and, more importantly, my breath back.”
